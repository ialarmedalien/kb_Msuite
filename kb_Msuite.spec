/*
A KBase module: kb_Msuite
This SDK module is developed to wrap the open source package CheckM which consists of a set of tools
for assessing the quality of genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, or metagenomes.
CheckM consists of a series of commands in order to support a number of different analyses and workflows.

        Runs CheckM as a command line local function.

        subcommand - specify the subcommand to run; supported options are lineage_wf, tetra, bin_qa_plot, dist_plot

        bin_folder - folder with fasta files representing each contig (must end in .fna)
        out_folder - folder to store output
        plots_folder - folder to save plots to

        seq_file - the full concatenated FASTA file (must end in .fna) of all contigs in your bins, used
                   just for running the tetra command
        tetra_File - specify the output/input tetra nucleotide frequency file (generated with the tetra command)

        dist_value - when running dist_plot, set this to a value between 0 and 100

        threads -  number of threads
        reduced_tree - if set to 1, run checkM with the reduced_tree flag, which will keep memory limited to less than 16gb (otherwise needs 40+ GB, which NJS worker nodes do have)
        quiet - pass the --quiet parameter to checkM, but doesn't seem to work for all subcommands
